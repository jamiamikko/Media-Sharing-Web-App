# Codebox - Media Sharing Web App
This is a Git Repository for a School Project, where we created a Media sharing web application, which we decided to call Codebox.
Codebox is used for storage, sharing and commeting different kinds of content. At this point it is recommended to only share posts which include images, though it is planned that in the future application will be able to share different kinds of media.

This repository includes folders: SchoolProject1 for actual Netbeans project with backend and frontend files, SchoolProjectFront for just frontend, DB for data base structure and sql for developing the database and UI for design mockups created at the very beginning of project.
