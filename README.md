# Codebox - Media Sharing Web App
This is a Git Repository for a School Project, where we created a Media sharing web application, which we decided to call Codebox.
Codebox is used for storage, sharing and commeting different kinds of content. At this point it is recommended to only share posts which include images, though it is planned that in the future application will be able to share different kinds of media.
